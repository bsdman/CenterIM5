Centerim 5 Alpha 2

How to get this version to work after compiling?

Press ^Q at any time to shutdown cim5. Pressing escape once will close almost
any window. Use tab, shift-tab or the arrow keys to move the focus from widget
to widget. Press F4 for a menu. In this menu there is an "Accounts..." option,
this can be used to add, edit and delete accounts. You can also copy the
pidgin xml files to configure cim5.

Once you have added (and enabled) an account the buddylist on the left of the
screen will fill. Select a lead in this tree and press enter to open
a conversation window. Type your message and press ^x to send it to
a recipient.

Incoming messages open automatically a new conversation window.

Please keep in mind that this is an alpha release.

Happy Hacking!
