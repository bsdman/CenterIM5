Centerim 5 Alpha 1

How to get this version to work after compiling?

Press ^Q at any time to shutdown cim5.
Press F4 for a menu. In this menu there is an option "Accounts", this
can be used to add, edit and delete accounts. There is also an
option to test the combobox widget. The rest of the options are not
implemented yet.
Backspace for some reason does not work, use ^H.

Pressing escape once will close almost any window. Use tab, shift-tab or
the arrow keys to move focus from widget to widget. Moving focus between
windows is not implemented yet.

Once you have added an account the buddylist on the left of the window
will fill. Select a lead in this tree and press enter to open a
conversation window. Start typing, and press ^x to send the message.

If accounts do not automatically logon after adding them, open
~/.centerim5/accounts.xml and set the auto-login setting from 0 to 1.
If you don't have an auto-login setting in your accounts.xml, add the following
section within <account>:
| <settings ui='centerim'>
| 	<setting name='auto-login' type='bool'>1</setting>
| </settings>

You can also copy the pidgin xml files to configure cim5.

Incoming messages should automatically open a new conversation window.
Incoming messages from a contact not in the list will currently cause
cim5 to shutdown with an abort.

Debugging can be enabled in ~/.centerim5/prefs.xml. Look for settings
with a `log_level' prefix. Valid values are none, critical, warning, error,
debug and info. We strongly recommend to use either none or debug, since
log_levels need to be reviewed.

Don't complain about a lack of features or usability. This is an alpha
release intended for developers who know how to fix this.

Happy Hacking!
