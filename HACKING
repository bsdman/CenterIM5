Centerim 5 Alpha 1

How to get this version to work after compiling?

Press ^Q at any time to shutdown cim5.
Press F4 for a menu. In this menu there is an option "Accounts", this can be
used to add, edit and delete accounts.

Pressing escape once will close almost any window. Use tab, shift-tab or the
arrow keys to move focus from widget to widget.

Once you have added (and enabled) an account the buddylist on the left of the
screen will fill. Select a lead in this tree and press enter to open
a conversation window. Start typing, and press ^x to send the message.

If accounts do not automatically logon after adding them, open
~/.centerim5/accounts.xml and set the auto-login setting from 0 to 1.
If you don't have an auto-login setting in your accounts.xml, add the following
section within <account>:
| <settings ui='centerim'>
| 	<setting name='auto-login' type='bool'>1</setting>
| </settings>

You can also copy the pidgin xml files to configure cim5.

Incoming messages should automatically open a new conversation window.

Debugging can be enabled in ~/.centerim5/prefs.xml. Look for settings with a
`log_level' prefix. Valid values are none, error, critical, warning, info and
debug.

Don't complain about a lack of features or usability. This is an alpha release
intended for developers who know how to fix this.

Happy Hacking!
