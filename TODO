TODO:
- see if `derwin' and similar can be used for scrollables.
- currently singletons use the Gamma singleton pattern
  change this to the Meyers singelton pattern, which
  has the automatic destruction advantage.
  Actually i like some discussion on this.
  The meyers variant has the disadvantage of not being
  able to control when the singleton is destroyed. It will
  exist until the app exits.
  (so lets leave things like they are for now)
- purple_pounces_load
- purple_debug_set_enabled
- better error catching in main
- reference counters for singletons, only delete when noone else
  references this class
- grep for todo's and fix them
- add const in a lot of places
- put everything (in cppconsui) in a CppConsUI namespace ?
- purple_pounces_load
- purple_debug_set_enabled
- purple_conversations_set_ui_ops which was in null_ui_init
  where should it go? probably in the Centerim object
- better error catching in main
- put something in: README AUTHORS ChangeLog NEWS
- make sure default constructors are not callable for all
  classes where this applies
- Add an init function to cppconsui which calls
  bindtextdomain (PACKAGE, LOCALEDIR); (as explained by
  <http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/gettext.html#Libraries>
  also make the translations proper)
- see what more files can be removed from git
- see wether we can lose gettext.h from src/
- add function descriptions in the header files
  you pick a format (Doxygen? you choose!)
- make sure the copy constructor of singletons is private
- make sure Curses.h is not distributed with cppconsui (can be
  done in cppconsui/Makefile.am!)
 
Less important todo's which sometimes are just ideas:
- Add option to save/display buddy icon
- Order switch statements, put most used cases on top
- Replace `if (!window) return;'-like constructs with
  g_return_if_fail/succes ??
