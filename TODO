TODO:
- purple_pounces_load
- purple_debug_set_enabled
- better error catching in main
- reference counters for singletons, only delete when noone else
  references this class
- grep for todo's and fix them
- add const in a lot of places
- put everything (in cppconsui) in a CppConsUI namespace ?
- purple_pounces_load
- purple_debug_set_enabled
- purple_conversations_set_ui_ops which was in null_ui_init
  where should it go? probably in the Centerim object
- better error catching in main
- put something in: README AUTHORS ChangeLog NEWS
- make sure default constructors are not callable for all
  classes where this applies
- Add an init function to cppconsui which calls
  bindtextdomain (PACKAGE, LOCALEDIR); (as explained by
  <http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/gettext.html#Libraries>
  also make the translations proper)
- see what more files can be removed from git
- see wether we can lose gettext.h from src/
 
Less important todo's which sometimes are just ideas:
- Add option to save/display buddy icon
- Order switch statements, put most used cases on top
- Replace `if (!window) return;'-like constructs with
  g_return_if_fail/succes ??
