TODO:
- Horizontal ListBox: add option to make every item the same width
- All classes should have a copy constructor and an
  operator=().
- using panel.h might not be a bad idea after all.
  what is needed is simple enough to implement with
  panels.
- see if `derwin' and similar can be used for scrollables.
- purple_pounces_load
- better error catching in main
- grep for todo's and fix them
- add const in a lot of places
- put everything (in cppconsui) in a CppConsUI namespace ?
- put something in: README AUTHORS ChangeLog NEWS
- make sure default constructors are not callable for all
  classes where this applies
- Add an init function to cppconsui which calls
  bindtextdomain (PACKAGE, LOCALEDIR); (as explained by
  <http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/gettext.html#Libraries>
  also make the translations proper)
- add function descriptions in the header files
- colorscheme should use same concept as KeyConfig so it is possible to get
  all registered colorschemes at startup time
- add fill() method to curses wrapper
- options window, for the start with debug options
- statusbar and top-statusbar as known from cim4
- TextEntry -- hide passwords with asterisks, fix cursor movement that goes
  outside the area
- pending auth and auth request windows
- request UI ops implementation
- notice UI ops implementation
- fix and put back cmake build
 
Less important todo's which sometimes are just ideas:
- Add option to save/display buddy icon
- Use the fact noted about in g_utf8_offset_to_pointer doc.
